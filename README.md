# Laravel Recaptcha

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-recaptcha
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

``` php
'providers' => [
    // ... Illuminate Providers
    // ... App Providers
    BrianFaust\Recaptcha\ServiceProvider::class
];
```

And, for convenience, add a facade alias to this same file at the bottom:

``` php
'aliases' => [
    // ... Illuminate Facades
    'Recaptcha' => BrianFaust\Recaptcha\Facades\Recaptcha::class
];
```

## Configuration

Laravel Recaptcha supports optional configuration.

To get started, you'll need to publish all vendor assets:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BrianFaust\Recaptcha\ServiceProvider"
```

This will create a `config/recaptcha.php` file in your app that you can modify to set your configuration. Also, make sure you check for changes to the original config file in this package between releases.

## Usage

##### Validate a captcha from a request

``` php
$this->validate($request, ['g-recaptcha-response' => 'required|recaptcha']);
```

##### Render captcha

``` php
{!! app('recaptcha')->render() !!}
```

##### Render captcha *(with laravelcollective/html)*

``` php
{!! Form::recaptcha() !!}
```
